### Simple NestJS API that uses Authorization and authenticate users.

Used the [TypeORM](https://github.com/typeorm/typeorm) for [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com) database connection and [class-validator](https://github.com/typestack/class-validator) for validate credentials.

Created by @TenDan thanks to the [NestJS](https://github.com/nestjs/nest) [Docs](https://docs.nestjs.com/techniques/authentication)
